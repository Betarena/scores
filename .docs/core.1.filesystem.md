          ‚Ü≥ *.svg
        ‚Ü≥ loaders/
            | üì£ Contains respective loaders.
        ‚Ü≥ New-Widget-Widget.svelte

            | üì£ Is the MAIN widget loader layout, used for showing the widget outline and it's preloading-state. Used in
            | conjuction with the .svelte files in the laoders/ folder, containing .svg elements within.
