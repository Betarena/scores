## About

### Betarena Scores Platform

We are building the first open-source live results and statistics platform with community involvement features for data insertion. The project includes a blockchain component that will allow participants to receive rewards based on their participation and also to stake the future Token of the platform.

## ⚙ Development / Project

See the `.docs/` directory for more (1) information about the project, (2) it's quirks, (3) code-style, (4) how to setup development, and more.

### SIWE Authentication

The middleware exposes a `POST /auth/siwe` endpoint that verifies an Ethereum
signature and returns a Firebase custom token. Set the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
environment variable with the Firebase Admin SDK service account JSON to enable
this flow.
