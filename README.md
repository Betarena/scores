### Betarena Scores Platform

### About

We are building the first open-source live results and statistics platform with community involvement features for data insertion. The project includes a blockchain component that will allow participants to receive rewards based on their participation and also to stake the future Token of the platform.

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.

### SEO Optimization

This porject is optimized using the `svelte-seo` plugin library [here](https://github.com/artiebits/svelte-seo#svelte-seo-options)

### GraphQL Support

For the ability to use `GraphQL` for the Widget in Svelte, `graphql-request` was utilized - [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-request)

`@apollo-client` does not work correctly with `sveltekit` [1](https://github.com/timhall/svelte-apollo/issues/97)
**solution**: using `graphql-request` instead.

### localStorage()

The widget stores the users `one-off` voting using the `.localStorage()` for the ability to give the user a history of past votings.
