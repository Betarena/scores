## Betarena Scores Platform

### About

We are building the first open-source live results and statistics platform with community involvement features for data insertion. The project includes a blockchain component that will allow participants to receive rewards based on their participation and also to stake the future Token of the platform.

## ⚙ Development

Check for the `origin/dev` environmnet version live on `Heroku` -> [betarena-scores-platform.herokuapp.com](https://betarena-scores-platform.herokuapp.com/).
A more rigorous development link and `application` is being utilized for the development of the platform on a separate `Heroku` instance -> [scores-testing-app.herokuapp.com](https://scores-testing-app.herokuapp.com/).

### Built With

This project is dependent on the following libraries and technologies:

- [`svelte`]()
- [`sveltekit`]()
- [`color-thief`]()
- [`svelte-seo`](https://github.com/artiebits/svelte-seo#svelte-seo-options)
- [`graphql-request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-request)

`@apollo-client` does not work correctly with `sveltekit` [1](https://github.com/timhall/svelte-apollo/issues/97)
**solution**: using `graphql-request` instead.

### Dev Environment

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Production Environment

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
